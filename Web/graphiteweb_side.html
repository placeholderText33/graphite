        <h1 class="paragraph_header">The graphite project.</h1>
        <h2 id="intro_text">The graphite project is a web-based simulation tool made using JavaScript. Its primary aim is to provide a visual and interactive approach to learning physics, and being web-based ensures that it can seen by as many people as possible.
            The particular focus of this program is upon simulating concepts found within A-Level physics, mainly those to do with dynamics. As such it is primarily targeted towards A-Level students,
            but anyone is free to use this program for their needs.</h2>
        <h1 class="paragraph_header">Capabilities of this program.</h1>
        <h2 id="capability_text">The features of the program fall into two primary categories: those concerning the physics engine underpinning it, and those concerning its UI. The engine is capable of simulating momentum, impulse, both elastic and inelastic collisions
            and friction. These concepts can all be simulated for rigid bodies (the only current supported type of object that can be simulated), with the engine also supporting collisions between both rigid bodies and straight surfaces. The UI provides additional tools 
            that can be used to better understand certain aspects of the simulation. There is support for visualising certain vectors and changing the properties of the aforementioned rigid bodies in real time.
